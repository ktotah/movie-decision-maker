# Movie Decision Maker

## Description

The Movie Decision Maker is an interactive web application tailored to assist movie enthusiasts in selecting a film to enjoy. By leveraging IMDb's top 250 movie list, our application offers user-friendly filters for genre, duration, and rating, powered by the OMDB API for detailed movie information. In addition, users can watch movie trailers directly within the app, thanks to the YouTube API integration. The "Surprise Me" feature adds an element of spontaneity by randomly selecting a movie for the user, while client-side storage ensures a personalized experience by keeping track of previously watched films.

During the development process, we encountered the typical challenge of integrating server-side APIs, which was an enriching learning experience. This step was crucial for accessing dynamic, up-to-date content, and for providing an immersive and responsive interface without relying on traditional alert, confirm, or prompt JavaScript methods, aligning with modern web practices.

## Screenshot
Below is a **screenshot** of the deployed Movie Decision Maker application. The interface prominently displays the application's title, "Movie Decision Maker" (stylized in a way that is reminiscent of a bankrupt movie company), and invites users to filter IMDb's top 250 movies based on their preferences. The screenshot shows a selection interface where users can filter movies by genre, duration, and rating. Additionally, there is a feature to exclude movies that have already been watched. Users can either choose a movie by clicking the 'Find A Movie' button or use the 'Surprise Me!' feature for a random selection.

The main area of the application displays a list of movies that users can interact with: 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Godfather', and others, each accompanied by checkboxes to mark them as watched. Clicking on a movie title reveals further details below, including the movie's poster, genre, runtime, and other information. A YouTube trailer for the selected movie is also displayed, illustrating the application's use of the YouTube API for direct trailer links.
